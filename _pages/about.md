I am a Data Scientist at OSP Dresden (member of the Otto Group), utilizing machine learning to solve problems in retail and logistics. Previously, I completed a MSc in Physics at the Technical University of Dresden and worked on deep reinforcement learning for autonomous driving.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, especially in deep learning and reinforcement learning. I co-organize the [WiMLDS](http://wimlds.org/about-the-dresden-team/) (Women in Machine Learning & Data Science) Dresden Chapter.
