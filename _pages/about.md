I am a PhD candidate at LUHAI in Hannover. My research interests lie at the intersection of automated machine learning (AutoML) and interpretable machine learning.

Before starting my PhD in 2022, I received a masterâ€™s degree in Physics from TU Dresden and worked on the application of machine learning to different problems in the industry for a few years.
